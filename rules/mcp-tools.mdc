# Available MCP Tools

Use these tools for cross-repository workflows:

- **JIRA MCP**: Search RHOAIENG issues, get issue details, find related work
- **GitHub MCP**: Search PRs/issues across forks, get commit details, compare branches
- **Slack MCP**: Search for discussions about issues/PRs
- `mcp_ignition-mcp_task_*` These are repository-specific tools for workflow automation, and should be preferred over generic tool calls.
- `mcp_ignition-mcp_launch_*` These are repository-specific tools for launching tests. They start a debugger - debugging features can be used or ignored. Prefer running tests with these over generic tool calls.
