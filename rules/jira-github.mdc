# JIRA and GitHub Integration

## JIRA Integration

- Primary project key: **RHOAIENG**
- When searching for issues, use RHOAIENG as the default project
- Issues may reference commits/PRs across all three forks
- Always check if a JIRA has existing PRs in any fork before starting work

### Fetching JIRA Context

When fetching a JIRA issue, always:
1. Use `fields: *all` and `expand: changelog` to get complete information
2. Check the changelog for **RemoteIssueLink** entries - these contain GitHub PR/issue links
3. Follow ALL linked PRs, issues, and related JIRAs to build full context
4. Check parent issues and sub-tasks for additional context

### Resolving Ambiguous GitHub References

GitHub PR/issue numbers (e.g., "#942") are **repository-specific** and ambiguous:
- A reference to "#942" in a JIRA could be from any of the three forks
- Cherry-pick PRs often mention the original PR number from a different fork
- If a referenced PR seems unrelated, check the same number in other forks:
  - `kserve/kserve#942`
  - `opendatahub-io/kserve#942`
  - `red-hat-data-services/kserve#942`
- The JIRA changelog's RemoteIssueLink usually includes the full URL which disambiguates the repo

## PR Description Conventions

When creating or reviewing PRs:

1. **Cherry-picks**: Include source reference in description
   - Example: "Cherry-pick of kserve/kserve#1234"
   - Example: "Backport of opendatahub-io/kserve#567"

2. **JIRA references**: Include JIRA key in title or description
   - Example: "[RHOAIENG-1234] Fix validation bug"

3. **Cross-fork coordination**: Note if PR needs cherry-picking to other forks
