# Git Workflow

## Commit Signing Requirements

All commits must include:
- **Signed-off-by** (`-s`): DCO signoff line in commit message
- **GPG signature** (`-S`): Cryptographic signature

Always use `git commit -s -S` when creating commits.

## Commit Message Conventions

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for upstream contributions:

```
<type>: <description> (#PR)

<optional body>

Signed-off-by: Your Name <email@example.com>
```

### Type Prefixes

| Prefix | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| `feat:` | New features |
| `fix:` | Bug fixes |
| `chore:` | Maintenance, dependency updates |
| `ci:` | CI/CD changes |
| `docs:` | Documentation |

### Optional Scope

Include scope in parentheses when helpful: `fix(llmisvc): description`

### Examples

```
feat: Add pathTemplate configuration for inference service routing (#4817)

Signed-off-by: Your Name <email@example.com>
```

```
fix: clear stale router and scheduler conditions on config changes (#4876)

Signed-off-by: Your Name <email@example.com>
```

### CVE References

For security fixes, reference the CVE directly in the subject:
```
CVE-2024-43598: Update lightgbm version to 4.6.0 (#4799)
```

### Multi-Author Commits

When multiple contributors are involved, add Co-authored-by trailers:
```
Signed-off-by: Primary Author <primary@example.com>
Co-authored-by: Other Contributor <other@example.com>
```

## Git Worktrees

**Always use worktrees for tasks.** Keep the main repo clean (fetch-only).

**Worktrees are for tasks, not branches.** If the target fork/branch was wrong, rebase the worktree in-place rather than creating a new worktree. The task hasn't changed, just the base.

**Run worktree commands automatically.** Don't just present commands - execute them directly using terminal tools. Run setup script and open in Cursor after creation.

**Always run setup and open worktrees in Cursor after creation.** Run the setup script from the main repo to symlink `.vscode` and `.cursor`, then open in Cursor.

```bash
# From main repo
cd ~/projects/kserve
git fetch --all
git worktree add ../kserve-RHOAIENG-1234 -b RHOAIENG-1234/fix odh/release-v0.15

# Setup worktree (symlinks .vscode/.cursor from main repo)
.vscode/scripts/setup-worktree.sh ../kserve-RHOAIENG-1234

# Open in Cursor
cursor ../kserve-RHOAIENG-1234

# Optional: setup Python venv (in the new Cursor window)
.vscode/scripts/setup-dev-env.sh

# After PR merges, cleanup
cd ~/projects/kserve
git worktree remove ../kserve-RHOAIENG-1234
```

**Note:** If git remotes are not configured, run `.cursor/scripts/setup-git-remotes.sh` first (see fork-structure rules).

### Changing the Base Branch In-Place

If you started on the wrong base (e.g., ODH instead of upstream), rebase in-place:

```bash
# Stash uncommitted changes
git stash -u -m "WIP changes"

# Reset to the correct base
git fetch upstream
git reset --hard upstream/master

# Apply stashed changes
git stash pop
```

**Create a handoff prompt** with full context for the new agent session. Write the prompt to `.agent-prompt` in the worktree before running setup:

```bash
# Create handoff prompt with full context
cat > ../kserve-RHOAIENG-1234/.agent-prompt <<'EOF'
Context:
- JIRA: RHOAIENG-1234 - Fix stale route cleanup after serverless deletion
- Target: odh/release-v0.15 (2.25 patch, ODH-specific OpenShift Route handling)

Research findings:
- Routes in istio-system not cleaned up when Serverless isvc deleted
- OpenShift Route handling is ODH-specific (not in upstream)
- No existing fix in any fork

Next steps:
- Investigate Route cleanup in ingress reconciler
- Add cross-namespace Route deletion on isvc delete
- Add e2e test for serverless-to-raw migration
EOF

# Setup worktree (symlinks .vscode/.cursor, copies prompt to clipboard)
.vscode/scripts/setup-worktree.sh ../kserve-RHOAIENG-1234 --open
```

The `.agent-prompt` file is copied to clipboard by `setup-worktree.sh` so you can paste it into the new Cursor window.

**Include in the handoff prompt:**
- JIRA key and summary
- Target fork/branch with rationale
- Key research findings (linked PRs, root cause hypothesis)
- Concrete next steps for implementation
