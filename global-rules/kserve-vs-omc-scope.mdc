# odh-model-controller Scope

This controller **extends** KServe with OpenShift/ODH integrations. It does NOT implement core model serving.

## Belongs to odh-model-controller

- OpenShift Routes (creation, TLS, timeouts)
- ServiceMeshMember / Istio resources (PeerAuth, Telemetry)
- AuthConfig (Authorino) / AuthPolicy (Kuadrant)
- NetworkPolicy resources
- ServiceMonitor / PodMonitor / metrics dashboards
- CA certificate trust (odh-trusted-ca-bundle, etc.)
- NVIDIA NIM Account management
- Model Registry sync
- Webhooks (protected namespace validation, default annotations)

## Belongs to KServe (NOT this repo)

- Predictor/Transformer/Explainer Deployments
- Model loading, storage access, container images
- Autoscaling (HPA/VPA, scale-to-zero)
- Knative Service creation (Serverless mode)
- ServingRuntime container specs
- Inference request/response handling
